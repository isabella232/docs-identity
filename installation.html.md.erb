    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <%= vars.product_name %> Identity Service Broker is
    deployed as an app from a BOSH errand, and has no associated BOSH
    VMs that require selecting a corresponding network. If you are forced to select
    a network during installation, select the <strong>Deployment</strong> network,
    also known as the**<%= vars.app_runtime_full %>** network.</p>

1. In the Ops Manager Dashboard, do the following to complete the installation:

## <a id='update'></a>Update SSL and Load Balancer

You must update the SSL certificate for the domains listed below for each plan you create.
Depending on your infrastructure and load balancer, you must also update your
load balancer configuration for the following domains:

* `*.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`

* `*.APPS-DOMAIN`

* `*.login.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`

* `*.uaa.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`


## <a id='configure'></a> Configure Application Security Groups

<%= vars.product_name %> requires the following network connections:

* TCP connection to load balancer(s) on port 443
* TCP and UDP connection to Domain Name Servers on port 53
* (Optional) TCP connection to your external identity provider on port 80 or 443

To enable access to <%= vars.product_name %>, you must ensure your
Application Security Group allows access to the load balancer(s) and domain
name servers that provide access to Cloud Controller and UAA. Optionally, you
can configure access to your external identity provider to receive SAML
metadata. For how to set up application security groups, see [Application Security
Groups](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html).

## <a id="update-addons"></a>Update Add-ons to Run with Xenial Stemcell

<%= vars.product_name %> v1.7.1 and later requires a Xenial stemcell.
If you are using any of the following BOSH Add-ons with your deployment,
you must update the add-on definition to include the Xenial stemcell before you
deploy <%= vars.product_name %> v1.7.1:

+ Pivotal File Integrity Monitoring.
