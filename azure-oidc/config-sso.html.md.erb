title: Configuring an OIDC Service Provider in SSO
owner: Identity Service
---

This topic describes how to add an OpenID Connect (OIDC) external identity provider to your Pivotal Single Sign-On (SSO) service plan, using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as an example.

Follow the steps below to set up an OIDC provider for the SSO service.

1. Log in to the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` using your UAA administrator credentials.
You can find these credentials in your Pivotal Application Service tile in Ops Manager under the **Credentials** tab.

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the drop-down menu.

1. Click **New Identity Provider**.

1. Enter an **Identity Provider Name**. This value in all lowercase with dashes replacing spaces becomes your **Origin Key**. For example, `Example Azure Origin` becomes `example-azure-origin`. If you did not enter this for your OAuth Clientâ€™s authorized redirect URIs, [go back](./config-azure.html#relying) and edit the value in Azure.

1. Enter a **Description**. Space developers see this description when they select an identity provider for their app.

1. Under **Identity Provider type**, select **OpenID Connect** .

1. Clear the **Enable Discovery** checkbox and enter the following information from the **OpenID Connect metadata endpoint** you constructed at the end of the [previous section](./config-azure.html#relying).
  - For **Authorization Endpoint URL**, enter in the `authorization_endpoint` value from the metadata endpoint.
  - For **Token Endpoint URL**, enter the `token_endpoint` value from the metadata endpoint.
  - For **Token Key**, enter the `jwks_uri` value from the metadata endpoint.
  - For **Issuer**, enter the `issuer` value from the metadata endpoint.
  - For **User Info Endpoint URL**, enter the `userinfo_endpoint` value from the metadata endpoint.
  - For **Response Type**, select `id_token`.
  - For **Relying Party OAuth Client ID**, enter the **Application ID** value recorded from the previous section.
  - For **Relying Party OAuth Client Secret**, enter the **Client Secret** value recorded in the previous section.

1. Under **Advanced Settings** > **User Attributes**, map `user_name` to `unique_name`. This enables SSO to identify the authenticated user.

1. (Optional) Configure additional attribute mappings.

1. Click **Create Identity Provider** to save your settings.

1. (Optional) [Enable identity provider discovery](../idp-discovery.html#how-to) for the service plan.
