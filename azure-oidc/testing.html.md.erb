This topic describes how a Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) administrator can test the OpenID Connect (OIDC) connection between the Single Sign-On (SSO) service and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

You can test your identity provider integration by deploying the <a href="https://github.com/pivotal-cf/identity-sample-apps">Pivotal Single Sign-On Service Sample Applications</a>.

Follow the steps below to test your Single Sign-On connection.

1. Log in to Apps Manager at `https://apps.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` and navigate to the org and space where your app is located.

1. Under **Services**, locate the service instance of the SSO plan bound to your app.

1. On the identity provider sign-in page, enter your credentials and sign in.

1. If the app prompts for authorization to the necessary scopes, click **Accept**.

1. If you are now logged into your app, your Azure AD OIDC to SSO connection works.
