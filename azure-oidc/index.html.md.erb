title: Azure Active Directory OIDC Integration Guide Overview
owner: Identity Service
---

This documentation introduces how to set up Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with Open ID Connect (OIDC) as the identity provider for the Single Sign-On service running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft's multi-tenant cloud-based directory and identity management service.

To set up Azure AD with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), see the [Azure Active Directory SAML Integration Guide](../azure/index.html).

## <a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

To integrate Azure AD with Single Sign-On service using OIDC, you must have the following:

* An active Azure AD tenant
* A user with admin privileges

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To configure OIDC, you must have the Pivotal Single Sign-On service broker installed on your PCF deployment. You need to create a plan, grant any plan administrators, and specify any organizations this plan should be the authentication authority for. For help configuring plans, see the <a href="../manage-service-plans.html">Manage Service Plans</a> topic.</p>
