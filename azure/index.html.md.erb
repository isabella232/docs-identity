This documentation introduces how to set up Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) as the identity provider for the Single Sign-On service running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft's multi-tenant cloud based directory and identity management service.

For how to set up Azure AD with Open ID Connect (OIDC) , see [Azure Active Directory OIDC Integration Guide](../azure-oidc/index.html).

## <a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

To integrate Azure AD with Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF), you must have the following:

* An Azure AD subscription
* A user with admin privileges

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
  To configure SAML, you must have the Pivotal Single Sign-On service broker
  installed on your PCF deployment.
  You need to create a plan, grant any plan administrators, and specify any
  organizations this plan should be the authentication authority for.
