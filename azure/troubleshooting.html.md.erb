This topic describes how to resolve common errors that arise when configuring a single sign-on partnership between Azure Active Directory (AD) and Pivotal Single Sign-On (SSO).

##<a id='login'></a> Failed Login

#### Symptom:
You cannot log in to your SSO plan.

#### Solutions:

+ Pivotal recommends using a different browser or deleting your browser cache and history before 
you log in to your SSO plan. You SSO plan can fail if you are already logged in to Azure AD as the 
Global Administrator account that was used to setup all the configurations. 

+ If you failed to log in more than 5 times, your account will be locked by Azure for 30 minutes. 
There is currently no way to unlock an account in Azure AD, so wait for the lockout period.

+ Pivotal recommends testing your SSO plan from Azure AD to see the contents of the SAML assertion.
For more information, see [Test Your Configurations in Azure AD](./testing.html#ad).
