title: Configuring GCP as an OIDC Identity Provider
owner: Identity Service

This topic describes how to set up Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as an identity provider for a Single Sign-On (SSO) service plan
by configuring OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration in both Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) and GCP.

## <a id='gcp-rp'></a> Generate GCP Client Credentials

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform console.

1. Under the **Credentials** tab, click **Create credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.

	<%= image_tag 'gcp-create-oauth.png' %>

1. In the configuration pane that appears, select **Web application** under **Application type** and enter any **Name**.
   Under **Restrictions**, leave **Authorized JavaScript Origins** blank
   and for **Authorized redirect URIs** enter a redirect URI of the form `https://AUTH_DOMAIN/login/callback/ORIGIN_KEY`, where:
  - `AUTH_DOMAIN` is the full URL generated based on the **Auth Domain** setting you entered
when you [created the service plan](../manage-service-plans.html#create-svc-plan) that you are integrating with GCP.
  - `ORIGIN_KEY` is based on the **Identity Provider Name** you set in the SSO dashboard
     in [Set Up OIDC Identity Provider in SSO below](#gcp-oidc-sso).
     This value should have no spaces or uppercase letters.
     You might need to change this value later.

	<%= image_tag 'gcp-config-oauth.png' %>

1. Click **Create** and record the **client ID** and **client secret** generated.
   You will enter these values as your **Relying Party OAuth Client ID** and **Relying Party OAuth Client Secret**
   in the SSO Operator Dashboard in [Set Up OIDC Identity Provider in SSO below](#gcp-oidc-sso).

	<%= image_tag 'gcp-oauth-keypair.png' %>

## <a id='gcp-oidc-sso'></a> Set Up OIDC Identity Provider in SSO

1. Log in to the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` using your UAA administrator credentials.
   You can find these credentials in your Pivotal Application Service tile in Ops Manager under the **Credentials** tab.

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the drop-down menu.

1. Click **New Identity Provider**.

1. Enter an **Identity Provider Name**.
   This value in all lowercase with dashes replacing spaces becomes your **Origin Key**.
   For example, `Example Google Origin` becomes `example-google-origin`.
   If you did not enter this for your OAuth Clientâ€™s authorized redirect URIs,
   [go back](#gcp-rp) and edit the value in Google Cloud Platform.

1. Enter a **Description**. Space developers see this description when they select an identity provider for their app.

1. Select **OpenID Connect** as the **Identity Provider type**.

	<%= image_tag 'gcp-new-idp.png' %>

1. Make sure the **Enable Discovery** checkbox is selected, to enable OIDC discovery.

1. For **Discovery Endpoint URL**, enter `https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

1. Click **Fetch Scopes**.

1. Enter your **Relying Party OAuth Client ID** and **Relying Party OAuth Client Secret**
   from the [Generate GCP Client Credentials above](#gcp-rp).

	<%= image_tag 'gcp-oidc-settings.png' %>

1. Make sure that `openid` and `email` are selected as scopes.
   You can select additional scopes if you want.

	<%= image_tag 'gcp-scopes.png' %>

1. Under **Advanced Settings** > **User Attributes**, map `user_name` to `email`.
   This enables SSO to identify the authenticated user.

	<%= image_tag 'gcp-advanced-settings.png' %>

1. (Optional) Configure additional attribute mappings.

1. Click **Create Identity Provider** to save your settings.

1. (Optional) [Enable identity provider discovery](../idp-discovery.html) for the service plan.
