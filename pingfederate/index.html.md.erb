title: PingFederate Integration Guide Overview
owner: Identity Service
---

PingFederate is a federation server that provides identity management, single sign-on, and API security for the enterprise. This documentation describes how to configure a single sign-on partnership between PingFederate as the Identity Provider (IdP) and the Single Sign-On Service (SSO) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry as the Service Provider (SP).

SSO supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All SSO communication takes place over SSL.

## <a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

To integrate PingFederate with Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), you must have the following:

* PingFederate
* A user with admin privileges

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
  To configure SAML, you must have the Pivotal Single Sign-On service broker
  installed on your PCF deployment.
  You need to create a plan, grant any plan administrators, and specify any
  organizations this plan should be the authentication authority for.
  For help configuring plans, see the <a href="../manage-service-plans.html">Manage Service Plans</a> topic.
