This topic describes how to add an Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) external SAML identity provider to your Pivotal Single Sign-On (SSO) service plan.
For information about how to add a SAML provider in general, refer to [Add a SAML Provider](../configure-id-providers.html#config-saml-prov).

##<a id='download-metadata'></a> Download Identity Provider Metadata

1. Download the metadata from your Active Directory Federation Services server at the following URL: `https://YOUR-ADFS-HOSTNAME/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml`

##<a id='set-up-saml'></a> Set up SAML

1. Log in to the SSO dashboard at `https<span>:</span>//p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` as a Plan Administrator.

1. Select your plan and click **Manage Identity Providers** from the dropdown.

## <a id='config-id-prov'></a> Configure Your New Identity Provider

Follow the steps below to configure a new identity provider.

1. Enter an identity provider name below **Identity Provider Name**.

1. Type `SAML 2.0` below **Identity Provider Type**.

1. (Optional) Enter a description under **Identity Provider Description**. This is displayed to space developers when they select an identity provider for their app.

1. Click **SAML File Metadata (optional)** and then click **Upload Identity Provider Metadata** to upload the XML metadata that you downloaded from your ADFS server.

1. Under **Advanced SAML Settings**, click **Attribute Mappings** to enter the mappings. These mappings determine how user attributes are propagated from the identity provider (ADFS) to the service provider (SSO).
In particular, you might want to propagate ADFS's SAML groups to SSO's `external_groups`. <%# Is this commanded in the next step? %>

1. Under **User Schema Attribute**, select **external_groups**.

1. If you followed the steps in [Create Custom Value Groups](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/1-8/adfs/config-adfs.html#groups), type `groups` under **Attribute Name**.<br>
If you did not, type `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/group` under **Attribute Name**.<br><br>
An attribute mapping with a customized SAML assertion value looks like this:<br><br>

	<%= image_tag '../images/customized.png' %>

	An attribute mapping with a non-customized SAML assertion value looks like this:

	<%= image_tag '../images/non-customized.png' %>

1. Click **Create Identity Provider**.

1. From the identity provider list, click on the name of the ADFS identity provider and then click **Group Whitelist**.

1. Follow the instructions in
[Configure Group Whitelist for an External Identity Provider](../configure-id-providers.html#config-whitelist)
to enter the ADFS SAML group names to be propagated in the SSO-generated ID token.
These SAML groups are now included in the roles claim of the user’s ID token.

1. From the identity provider list, click on the name of the ADFS identity provider and then click **Resource Permissions**.

1. Follow the instructions in [Create or Edit Resource Permissions Mapping](../configure-id-providers.html#create-resource-perm) to map the user’s ADFS group memberships to their access token's scopes.
The resource permissions that the SAML groups were mapped to are now included in the scopes claim of the user's access token.
