title: Single Sign-On Overview
owner: Identity Service
---

This topic provides an overview of the [Single Sign-On](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-identity) service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

The Single Sign-On service is an all-in-one solution for securing access to applications and APIs on PCF. The Single Sign-On service provides support for native authentication, federated single sign-on, and authorization. Operators can configure native authentication and federated single sign-on, for example SAML, to verify the identities of application users. After authentication, the Single Sign-On service uses OAuth 2.0 to secure resources or APIs. 

## <a id="sso-overview"></a> Single Sign-On

The Single Sign-On service allows users to log in through a single sign-on service and access other applications that are hosted or protected by the service. This improves security and productivity since users do not have to log in to individual applications.

Developers are responsible for selecting the authentication method for application users. They can select native authentication provided by the User Account and Authentication (UAA) or external identity providers. UAA is an open source identity server project under the Cloud Foundry (CF) foundation that provides identity based security for applications and APIs.

SSO supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All SSO communication takes place over SSL.

## <a id="oauth2"></a> OAuth 2.0 Authorization

After authentication, the Single Sign-On service uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization. OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that delegates access to applications to access resources on behalf of a resource owner.

Developers define resources required by an application bound to a Single Sign-On (SSO) service instance and administrators grant resource permissions. See the <a href="./configure-apps/index.html">Configure Applications</a> topic for more details.

## <a id='upgrading'></a> Upgrade Path to the Latest Version

When upgrading PAS and SSO at the same time, follow the steps below in order:

1. If your SSO tile is not on your current PAS's recommended SSO version (see table below), upgrade it.
1. Upgrade PAS to the newer version.
1. If your SSO tile is not on the recommended version for the newer PAS version, upgrade the SSO tile.

<tr>
  <th>Recommended SSO Version</th>

\* As of PCF v2.0, _Elastic Runtime_ is renamed _Pivotal Application Service (PAS)_.

\** When you upgrade SSO from v1.5 to v1.6, you must first upgrade to PAS v2.0 and SSO v1.5.3. For information about upgrading to PCF v2.0,
   see [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).

### <a id='upgrading-example'></a> Upgrade Example
If you are using SSO v1.6.0 and PAS v2.1.0 and want to upgrade to SSO v1.7.0 and PAS v2.2.x,
you do the following:

1. Upgrade to SSO v1.7.x on PAS v2.1.0, which is the recommended SSO version for PAS v2.1.0.
1. Upgrade PAS to v2.2.x (newer PAS version).
1. No further updgrade is needed because SSO is already at v1.7.x, which is the PAS v2.2.x supported SSO version.
