<p class="note"><strong>Note: Single Sign-On for PCF v1.3 is no longer supported.</strong>
The support period for v1.3 has expired.
To stay up-to-date with the latest software and security updates,
upgrade to a supported version.</p>

This topic provides an overview of the [Single Sign-On](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-identity) service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

The Single Sign-On service is an all-in-one solution for securing access to applications and APIs on PCF. The Single Sign-On service provides support for native authentication, federated single sign-on, and authorization. Operators can configure native authentication and federated single sign-on, for example SAML, to verify the identities of application users. After authentication, the Single Sign-On service uses OAuth 2.0 to secure resources or APIs.

### Single Sign-On

The Single Sign-On service allows users to log in through a single sign-on service and access other applications that are hosted or protected by the service. This improves security and productivity since users do not have to log in to individual applications.

Developers are responsible for selecting the authentication method for application users. They can select native authentication provided by the User Account and Authentication (UAA) or external identity providers. UAA is an open source identity server project under the Cloud Foundry (CF) foundation that provides identity based security for applications and APIs.

### OAuth 2.0 Authorization

After authentication, the Single Sign-On service uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization. OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that delegates access to applications to access resources on behalf of a resource owner.

Developers define resources required by an application bound to a Single Sign-On (SSO) service instance and administrators grant resource permissions. See the <a href="./configure-apps/index.html">Configure Applications</a> topic for more details.

## <a id='upgrading'></a> Upgrading to the Latest Version

Consider the following compatibility information before upgrading Single Sign-On for PCF.
Pivotal recommends upgrading PCF before upgrading SSO to the supported version.
For example, when upgrading from PCF v1.8 to PCF v1.9,
upgrade PCF so that SSO v1.2 is running on PCF v1.9,
and then upgrade SSO v1.2 to SSO v1.3 as soon as possible.
