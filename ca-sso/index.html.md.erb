CA Single Sign-On (formally known as CA SiteMinder) is a Web Access Management system that supports advanced authentication, risk-based security policies, and federated identities. This documentation describes how to configure a single sign-on partnership between CA Single Sign-On as the Identity Provider (IdP) and the Single Sign-On Service (SSO) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry as the Service Provider (SP).

SSO supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All SSO communication takes place over SSL.

## <a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

To integrate CA Single Sign-On with Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), you need the following:

**Pivotal**

* PCF, v1.7.0 or later.
* Single Sign-On, v1.1.0 or later.

**CA Single Sign-On**

* CA Single Sign-On, v12.52 or later.
* A Signed Certificate by a Certificate Authority.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To configure SAML, you must have the Pivotal Single Sign-On service broker installed on your PCF deployment. You need to create a plan, grant any plan administrators, and specify any organizations this plan should be the authentication authority for. For help configuring plans, see the <a href="../manage-service-plans.html">Manage Service Plans</a> topic.</p>
