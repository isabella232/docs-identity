CA Single Sign-On (formally known as CA SiteMinder) is a Web Access Management system that supports advanced authentication, risk-based security policies, and federated identities. This documentation describes how to configure a single sign-on partnership between CA Single Sign-On as the Identity Provider (IdP) and the Single Sign-On Service (SSO) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry as the Service Provider (SP).

SSO supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All SSO communication takes place over SSL.

## <a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

To integrate CA Single Sign-On with Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), you need the following:

<strong>Pivotal</strong>

- PCF, version 1.7.0 or later

- Single Sign-On, version 1.1.0 or later

<strong>CA Single Sign-On</strong>

- CA Single Sign-On 12.52

- A Signed Certificate by a Certificate Authority

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To configure SAML, you must have the Pivotal Single Sign-On service broker installed on your PCF deployment. You need to create a plan, grant any plan administrators, and specify any organizations this plan should be the authentication authority for. For help configuring plans, see the <a href="../manage-service-plans.html">Manage Service Plans</a> topic.</p>
