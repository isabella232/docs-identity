This topic describes Identity Provider (IdP) Discovery and how to configure it for your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) apps that use the Single Sign-On (SSO) service.

## <a id="definition"></a> What it Does

If users with different email domains access the same PCF app, you can configure SSO to authenticate them through different identity providers.

In this situation, IdP Discovery streamlines the login experience by automatically redirecting the user to their own IdP and shielding them from seeing the IdPs of other app users.

When a user logs in to an app, an account chooser autofills their email address from any previous login, or presents a choice if they have logged in from more than one account. Users can add or remove accounts from the account chooser.

### Example

As an example, consider an app where some users log in with `@example.com` username and some with `@gmail.com` username. With IdP Discovery, users with both email domains can log in from the same login page, and do not have to see or choose from a list of login options that covers all the domains. IdP Discovery ascertains each user's IdP from their email domain.

## <a id="how-to"></a> Enable IdP Discovery

IdP Discovery is associated with a service plan, and configured for the apps bound to instances of that plan. To enable IdP Discovery for a service plan and the apps that use it, you must be a PCF Administrator or a Plan Administrator.

1. Enable IdP Discovery for the SSO Service Plan instance that your app is bound to:
	1. Log into the SSO Operator dashboard at `https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` using your User Account and Authentication (UAA) administrator credentials. You can find these credentials in your Pivotal Application Service tile in Ops Manager under the Credentials tab.
	1. Click the plan name and select **Configure** under the plan menu.
	1. Select the checkbox under the **Identity Provider Discovery** section and click **Save**.

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** under the plan menu.

1. Enter the Email domains you want to include as a comma-separated list under the configuration page for the identity provider plan.

1. In Apps Manager, navigate to your space, open the **Service** tab, and select your service instance.

1. Click the **Manage** link under the service name, and edit the app configuration by selecting the required Identity Providers.

After these steps, the login page will prompt for the username first:

And if the user enters their `@example.com` username, they will be redirected to the Okta login page:
