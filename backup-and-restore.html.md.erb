This topic describes how to back up and restore <%= vars.product_name %> for <%= vars.platform_name %>.

To back up and restore <%= vars.product_name %>, use the BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) tool to back up and restore <%= vars.platform_name %>. For more information, see [Backing Up and Restoring <%= vars.platform_name %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/backup-restore/index.html).

As part of backing up and restoring <%= vars.platform_name %>, BBR also backs up and restores the <%= vars.product_name %> tile information. The information is included in the Cloud Controller (CC) and User Account and Authentication (UAA) data of <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>.
