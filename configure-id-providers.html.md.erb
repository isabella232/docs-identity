This topic describes how administrators can use an internal user store or an external identity provider to manage user access to a Single Sign-On (SSO) service plan.

For each plan, SSO provides an internal user store that manages users. As an alternative to an internal user store, administrators can use an external identity provider to allow users who are externally managed to access applications.

## <a id='config-int-store'></a> Configure Internal User Store

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.run.pivotal.io` using your administrator credentials.

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the drop-down menu.

1. Click **Internal User Store** and select **Edit Provider** from the drop-down menu.

1. (Optional) Under **Authentication Policy** select one of the following:
	- **Disable Internal Authentication**: This option prevents authentication against the internal user store. You must have at least one external identity provider configured.
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The login page does not include the <strong>Email</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> fields if you select this option.</p>
	- **Disable User Management**: This option prevents all users, including administrators, from performing actions on internal users.
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The login page does not include <strong>Create Account</strong> and <strong>Reset Password</strong> links if you select this option.</p>

1. Under **Password Policy Settings**, select **Use Recommended Settings**, **Use Default Settings**, or enter custom settings in the fields below.

1. Click **Save Identity Provider**.

## <a id='add-to-int'></a> Add Internal Users From the Command Line

Before completing the following steps, you must contact [Pivotal Support](https://support.pivotal.io/) to request a client for managing users, apps, and resources for your plan.

You cannot add users to Service Plans from the SSO dashboard. In order to add users to the internal user store for a given Service Plan, you must use the UAA Command Line Interface (UAAC). If you do not already have the UAAC installed, run `gem install cf-uaac` in a terminal window. 

The following steps describe how to use UAAC to add users to the internal user store.

### <a id="update-client"></a>Step 1: Create an Admin Client

1. Follow the steps to [Create Admin Client](./configure-apps/index.html#admin) that can manage users in the Service Plan. Include the following scopes for the client:
	- clients.admin
	- scim.read
	- scim.write
2. Record the **App ID** and **App Secret**. These will be used as your client ID and client secret.

### <a id="adding-users"></a>Step 2: Create Users

1. Target the auth domain of your SSO service plan. This is the URL you provided when creating a Service Plan in the SSO dashboard.
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac target <span>https</span>://YOUR-AUTH-DOMAIN.login.run.pivotal.io</pre>

1. Fetch the **App ID** token for the admin client created above.
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac token client get ADMIN-CLIENT-ID
Client secret:
</pre>

1. When prompted with `Client secret`, enter the **App Secret** admin client secret recorded above.

1. Add new users by providing the user's email address, username, and password.
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac user add --emails YOUR-USER<span>@</span>EMAIL.COM
User name:  YOUR-USER
Password:  ****
Verify password:  ****
user account successfully added</pre>

1. (Optional) You can also create groups and add users to them.
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac group add
Group name:  YOUR-GROUP
  meta
    version: 0
    created: 2016-02-19T23:17:17.000Z
    lastmodified: 2016-02-19T23:17:17.000Z
  schemas: urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0
  id: 8725b5fd-8da2-4cfc-89b1-c57048f089c2
  displayname: YOUR-GROUP
</pre>
To add a member to your new group, use the following command.
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac member add YOUR-GROUP YOUR-USER</pre>

## <a id='passwd-policy'></a> Define Password Policy for the Internal User Store

Administrators can define the password policy for SSO users in the internal user store.
The password policy enforces rules that restrict the kinds of passwords users can create.

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.run.pivotal.io` using your administrator credentials.

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the drop-down menu.

1. Click **Internal User Store** and select **Edit Provider** from the drop-down menu.

1. Configure the following under the **Password Complexity** section:
    * **Min Length**: Specify the minimum password length.
    * **Uppercase**: Specify the minimum number of uppercase characters required in a password.
    * **Lowercase**: Specify the minimum number of lowercase characters required in a password.
    * **Special Characters**: Specify the minimum number of special characters required in a password.
    * **Numerals**: Specify the minimum number of numeric characters required in a password.

1. Configure the following under the **Lockout Policy** section:
    * **Failures Allowed**: Specify the number of failed login attempts allowed per hour before a user is locked out.
    * **Lockout Period**: Specify the number of seconds a user is locked out for after excessive failed login attempts.
    * **Password Expires**: Specify the number of months passwords are valid for before users needs to enter a new password.

1. Click **Save Identity Provider**.

## <a id='config-ext-settings'></a> Configure Service Provider SAML Settings

For each plan, the Single Sign-On service allows you to configure SAML settings when SAML is used for exchanging authentication and authorization data between the identity provider and the service provider. The SSO service provides the ability to sign authentication requests and require signed assertions from the external identity provider.

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.run.pivotal.io` using your administrator credentials.

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the drop-down menu.

1. Click **Configure SAML Service Provider**.

1. Configure the following settings:
	* **Perform signed authentication requests**: The service provider signs requests sent to the external identity provider.
	* **Require signed assertions**: The service provider requires that responses from the external identity provider are signed.

1. Click **Save** to save the configurations.

1. Click **Download Metadata**.

## <a id='config-ext-prov'></a> Add an External Identity Provider

See the following sets of instructions for how to configure the SSO service to use external identity providers that support SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and LDAP.

### <a id='config-saml-prov'></a> Add a SAML Provider

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.run.pivotal.io` using your administrator credentials.

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the drop-down menu.

1. Click **New Identity Provider**.

1. Enter an **Identity Provider Name**.

1. Select `SAML 2.0` as the Identity Provider Type.

1. Enter a **Description**. This is displayed to Space Developers when they select an identity provider for their app.

1. Enter the external identity provider metadata in one of the following ways:
    * Option 1: Provide the **Identity Provider Metadata URL** and click **Fetch Metadata**.
    * Option 2: Click **Upload Identity Provider Metadata** to upload XML metadata that you downloaded from your external identity provider.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you choose to upload the Identity Provider Metadata as an XML file, you will be unable to use the <strong>Fetch Metadata</strong> option to update your Identity Provider metadata later. If metadata changes on the Identity Provider side, you will have to manually re-upload them as an updated XML file.</p>

1. Configure any **User Attributes** to propagate from the identity provider to the service provider. These attributes can include email addresses, first or last names, or external groups. They are sent to apps via OpenID tokens, along with any other stored user information issued by the Single Sign-On service.
	* Select a **User Scheme Attribute** from the drop-down menu.
	* Enter a **SAML Attribute Name** with the corresponding attribute from the incoming SAML assertion.

1. Configure any **Custom Attributes** to propagate from the identity provider to the service provider. These attributes are sent to apps via OpenID tokens issued by the Single Sign-On service.
	* Enter a **Custom Attribute Name**.
	* Enter a **SAML Attribute Name** with the corresponding attribute from the incoming SAML assertion.

1. (Optional) Check **Persist Custom Attributes** if you want to expose custom user attributes through the `/userinfo` endpoint. Your app must also have the `user_attributes` scope assigned in order for the custom attributes to appear.

1. Click **Create Identity Provider** to save the identity provider.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To configure the service provider SAML settings, such as the signing of authentication requests and incoming assertions, click on <strong>Configure SAML Service Provider</strong> on the Identity Providers page.</p>

  - Enter a **Custom Attribute Name**.
  - Enter an **ID Token Attribute Name** with the corresponding attribute from the incoming OIDC ID token.

1. (Optional) Check **Persist Custom Attributes** if you want to expose custom user attributes through the `/userinfo` endpoint.  Your app must also have the `user_attributes` scope assigned in order for the custom attributes to appear.

1. Click **Create Identity Provider** to save the identity provider.

### <a id='config-ext-ldap'></a> Add an LDAP Identity Provider

When integrating with an external identity provider for LDAP, authentication becomes chained. An authentication attempt with a user's credentials is first attempted against the internal user store before the external LDAP identity provider. To avoid username collision, do not bootstrap or create users in the UAA directly. You may only have one LDAP external identity provider per service plan.

1. Log in to the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.run.pivotal.io` using your administrator credentials. 

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the drop-down menu.

1. Click **New Identity Provider**.

1. Enter an **Identity Provider Name**.

1. Enter a **Description**. This is displayed to Space Developers when they select an identity provider for their app.

1. Select `LDAP` as the **Identity Provider Type**. You may only have one LDAP provider per Service Plan.

1. Enter the external LDAP identity provider configurations:
  1. Enter the **Hostname** and **Port**.
  1. Select the applicable **Security protocol**.
  1. Select the applicable **Referral**.
  1. Enter the **User DN** and **Bind Password** for your LDAP service account.
  1. Under the **Users** section, enter the **Search Base**.
  1. Under the **Users** section, you may also enter in **Search Filter** (Optional).
  1. Under the **Users** section, you may select **Just in Time Provisioning**. If this option is enabled, users will be created at login time. If this option is not enabled, users must be created prior to being able to login.
  1. Under the **Groups** section, you may enter in enter the **Search Base** (optional) and **Search Filter** (optional) in order to associate LDAP groups with your user. If you wish to use the `memberOf` attribute on user objects, you can enter in the value `memberOf` as the Search Base instead of an LDAP path for a group OU, and the Search Filter value will be ignored.

1. Configure any **User Attributes** to propagate from the identity provider to the service provider. The configurable attributes are sent to apps via OpenID tokens, along with any other stored user information issued by the Single Sign-On service.
  1. Select a **User Scheme Attribute** from the dropdown.
  1. Enter an **LDAP Attribute Name** with the corresponding attribute from LDAP.

	Note that the only configurable attributes for LDAP are `given_name`, `family_name`, and `phone_number`.  Configuring `email` and `external_groups` has no effect on your LDAP integration.

1. Configure any **Custom Attributes** to propagate from the identity provider to the service provider. These attributes are sent to apps via OpenID tokens issued by the Single Sign-On service.
  - Enter a **Custom Attribute Name**.
  - Enter an **LDAP Attribute Name** with the corresponding attribute from LDAP.

1. (Optional) Check **Persist Custom Attributes** if you want to expose custom user attributes through the `/userinfo` endpoint.  Your app must also have the `user_attributes` scope assigned in order for the custom attributes to appear.

1. Click **Create Identity Provider** to save the identity provider.

1. (Optional) Transfer group memberships and roles from an existing LDAP groups to the SSO service as follows:
  1. To map existing LDAP user group memberships to SSO resources, create a permissions mapping for your LDAP identity provider as described in [Create or Edit Resource Permissions Mapping](#create-resource-perm) below.
  1. To propagate the existing LDAP user group memberships into the `roles` claim of the OpenID tokens issued by the Single Sign-On service, follow the procedure described in [Configure Group Whitelist for an External Identity Provider](#config-whitelist) below.

## <a id='delete-idp'></a> Delete an External Identity Provider

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.run.pivotal.io` using your administrator credentials.

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the drop-down menu.

1. Click on the name of your external identity provider.

1. Click **Delete** at the bottom of the page.

1. In the popup that appears, click **Delete Identity Provider** to confirm that you want to delete the identity provider, along with all of its configurations.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Note</strong>: Deleting an external identity provider deletes all of its configurations. Users will no longer be able to authenticate using the external identity provider. This action cannot be undone.</p>

## <a id='config-whitelist'></a> Configure Group Whitelist for an External Identity Provider

An administrator can include groups from an external identity provider in a Group Whitelist. The list of groups in the whitelist propagates in the ID token when a user authenticates through an external identity provider. An app can then retrieve from the ID token the list of external groups that the user belongs to. An administrator can use these groups to assign permissions by group rather than individual users.

For more details on how to create resource permission mappings, see <a href="./manage-resources.html#create-resource-perm">Create or Edit Resource Permissions</a>.

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.run.pivotal.io` using your administrator credentials.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For an app to retrieve an ID token or a <code>/userinfo</code> response containing external groups, the app must request the <code>roles</code> claim and the group whitelist must include the external groups.</p>

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the drop-down menu.

1. Click on the name of your external identity provider and select **Group Whitelist** from the drop-down menu.

1. Add a group name from your external identity provider.

1. Click **Save Group Whitelist**.
