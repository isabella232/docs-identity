### <a id="180-features"></a> Features

New features and changes in this release:

* **SSO Plan API**:
  SSO includes an API for managing SSO plans.
  The SSO Plan API provides an easy way for developers to do continuous deployment and
  continuous integration for SSO plans.
  For more information about automating SSO Plans, see the [SSO Plan API](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/sso-api)
  documentation and [Managing Service Plans](./manage-service-plans.html).<br><br>
  The SSO Plan API documentation includes instructions on how to automate the following steps in the SSO workflow:
  - [Managing CloudFoundry Organizations for SSO Plans](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/sso-api/#managing-cloudfoundry-organizations-for-sso-plans)
  - [Managing Plan Administrators for SSO Plans](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/sso-api/#managing-plan-administrators-for-sso-plans)
  - [Creating New System Operators](./creating-new-system-operators.html).

* **Expanded API functionality for configuring SSO Plans and identity providers**:
  - **Enabling default identity providers**:
  For PCF 2.4 and later, you can enable a default IDP so that users are automatically
  redirected to an appropriate enterprise IDP.
  For more information, see
  [Enable Default Identity Provider](./manage-service-plans-api.html#enable-default-idp).
  - **Disabling and re-enabling SSO plans:**
  For PCF v2.4 and later, you can disable SSO plans that are no longer in use.
  You can re-enable disabled plans when they need to be used again.
  For more information, see [Disable SSO Plans](./manage-service-plans-api.html#disable-sso-plans).
  - **Password Grant for OpenID Connect (OIDC):**
  For PCF v2.2 and later, you can enable the OIDC password grant so that native apps,
  such as mobile apps, can forward credentials to the enterprise IDP for authentication.
  This allows native apps to use credentials stored in the enterprise IDP.
  For more information, see [Enable Password Grant for OpenID Connect](./configure-id-providers-api.html#enable-client-auth).

* **Login Hints functionality in Authorization Request API:**
  For PCF v2.2 and later, when making an authorization code, password, or implicit
  grant request, you can provide a login hint so that the end user is automatically
  redirected to the appropriate IDP.
  For more information, see [Using Login Hints](./integrating-sso.html#using-login-hint).

* **Improved access error handling**:
  Improved error messages and instructions for access errors on the SSO UI.

* **Improved error message for space-protected resources**:
  If users try to create resources already in use in a separate space using the cf CLI or SSO UI,
  SSO returns a consistent error message.
  For more information about space protection, see
  [About Space Protection for Resources](./manage-resources.html#space-protection).

### <a id="180-known-issues"></a> Known Issues

There are no known issues for this release.

## <a id="deprecation"></a> Deprecation Notice
In future releases of SSO, we may plan to deprecate the following features:

* **[User management interface](./manage-users.html)**: We plan to move from the user management UI to direct UAA CLI usage for any administrator user management capabilities.
* **[Password policies for the internal user store](./configure-id-providers.html#passwd-policy)**: UAA plans to focus on enterprise identity providers as the core provider of users for applications in production in the future.
* **[Native MFA](./manage-service-plans-api.html#enable-authentication)**: UAA plans to focus on enterprise identity providers and MFA provided from the enterprise identity provider as the core provider of users for applications in the future.

In addition, we may no longer recommend usage of the internal user store in production based upon the above items.

If you have any feedback or concerns around these future features, please let us know via [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPHaId-qk4QGzGL0GE3cXhH1XUgKFQOpNL2j4SqgjoCkn3Hg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
