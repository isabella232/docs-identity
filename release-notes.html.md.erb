## <a id="180"></a> v1.8.0

**Release Date: MONTH XX, 2018**

<!-- Is this really a breaking change? -->

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> For SSO v1.8.0 and later, configure distinct resource 
names when dealing with cross-space scopes. For more information, see Improved error message for duplicate resources
in <a href="#features">Features</a> below.</p>

<!-- when users try 
to create resources already in use in a separate space using Cloud Foundry Command Line Interace 
(cf CLI), SSO now returns an explicit error instead of failing silently.  See the below feature details for more information -->

### <a id="features"></a> Features

New features and changes in this release:

<!-- Why all these links? How are they related to the API? Can they be put elsewhere in the docs -->

* **SSO Plan API**:
  SSO includes an API for managing SSO plans.
  The SSO Plan API provides an easy way for developers to do continuous deployment and 
  continuous integration for SSO plans.
  For more information about automating SSO Plans, see [Managing Service Plans](./manage-service-plans.html) and [Creating New System Operators](./creating-new-system-operators.html).

<!-- For automating identity provider and application configurations, please refer to the existing documentations:
- [Configuring Apps](./configure-apps)
- [Updating Identity Providers with UAAC](./configure-id-providers-api.html) -->

* **Expanded API functionality for configuring SSO plans and identity providers (IDP)**:
  - **Enabling default identity providers:**
  For PCF 2.4 and later, you can enable a default IDP so that users are automatically redirected to an appropriate enterprise IDP.
  For more information, see [Enable Default Identity Provider](./manage-service-plans-api.html#enable-default-idp).
  - **Disabling and re-enabling SSO plans:**
  For PCF v2.4 and later, you can disable SSO plans that are no longer in use. You can re-enable disabled plans when they need to be used again.
  For more information, see [Disable SSO Plans](./manage-service-plans-api.html#disable-sso-plans).
  - **Password Grant for OpenID Connect (OIDC):**
  On PCF v2.2 and later, you can enable the OIDC password grant so that native apps, such as mobile apps, can forward credentials to the enterprise IDP for authentication.
  This allows native apps to use credentials stored in the enterprise IDP.
  For more information, see [Enable Password Grant for OpenID Connect](./configure-id-providers-api.html#enable-client-auth).

* **Login Hints functionality in Authorization Request API:**
  For PCF v2.2 and later, when making an authorization code, password, or implicit grant request, a login hint can be provided so that the end user is automatically redirected to the appropriate IDP.
  For more information, see [Using Login Hints](./integrating-sso.html#using-login-hint).

* **Improved access error handling**:
  Improved error message and instruction in the presence of access errors on the SSO UI.

* **Improved error message for duplicate resources**:
  When users try to create resources already in use in a separate space (via cf CLI or SSO UI), SSO now returns a consistent error message.
