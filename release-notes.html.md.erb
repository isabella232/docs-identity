## <a id="180"></a> v1.8.0

**Release Date: MONTH XX, 2018**

### <a id="features"></a> Features

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> Starting from SSO v1.8.0, when users try to create resources already in use in a separate space via cf CLI,
SSO now returns an explicit error instead of failing silently. Please configure distinct recource names when dealing with cross-space scopes. See the below feature details for more information.</p>

New features and changes in this release:

* **SSO Plan API**:
  SSO now provides an API for creating, retrieving, listing, updating, and deleting SSO Plans.
  SSO Plan API is intended to provide an easy way for developers to perform automation, continuous deployment/integration for SSO Plans.
  For more information & documentation, see [SSO Plan API Docs](https://pivotal.github.io/sso-api-docs) and [Managing Service Plans](./manage-service-plans.html).
  As part of the SSO Plan API, we also provided instructions on how to automate the following common steps in the SSO workflow:
  - [Managing CloudFoundry Organizations for SSO Plans](https://pivotal.github.io/sso-api-docs/#managing-cloudfoundry-organizations-for-sso-plans)
  - [Managing Plan Administrators for SSO Plans](https://pivotal.github.io/sso-api-docs/#managing-plan-administrators-for-sso-plans)
  - [Creating New System Operators](./creating-new-system-operators.html).
  - For automating identity provider and application configurations, please refer to the existing documentations:
    - [Configuring Apps](./configure-apps)
    - [Updating Identity Providers with UAAC](./configure-id-providers-api.html)

* **Expanded API functionality for configuring SSO Plans and identity providers**:
  - **Disabling and re-enabling SSO Plans (PCF 2.4+ only)**:
  For PCF 2.4 and higher, SSO plans that are no longer in use can be disabled. Disabled plans can be re-enabled later when they need to be used again.
  For more information, see [Disable SSO Plans](./manage-service-plans-api.html#disable-sso-plans).
  - **Enabling default identity providers (PCF 2.4+ only)**:
  For PCF 2.4 and higher, a default IDP can be enabled so that end users are automatically redirected to an appropriate enterprise IDP.
  For more information, see [Enable Default Identity Provider](./manage-service-plans-api.html#enable-default-idp).
  - **Password Grant for OpenID Connect (PCF 2.2+ only)**:
  On PCF 2.2 and higher, OIDC password grant can be enabled so that native apps, such as mobile apps, can forward credentials on to the enterprise IDP for authentication.
  This allows native and mobile applications to use credentials stored in the enterprise IDP.
  For more information, see [Enable Password Grant for OpenID Connect](./configure-id-providers-api.html#enable-client-auth).

* **Login Hints functionality in Authorization Request API (PCF 2.2+ only)**:
  For PCF v2.2 and later, when making an authorization code, password, or implicit grant request, a login hint can be provided so that the end user is automatically redirected to the appropriate IDP.
  For more information, see [Using Login Hints](./integrating-sso.html#using-login-hint).

* **Improved access error handling**:
  Improved error message and instruction in the presence of access errors on the SSO UI.

* **Improved error message for space-protected resources**:
  When users try to create resources already in use in a separate space (via cf CLI or SSO UI), SSO now returns a consistent error message. For more information on space protection, see [About Space Protection for Resources](./manage-resources.html#space-protection).
