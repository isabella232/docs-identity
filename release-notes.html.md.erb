**Release Date: April 19, 2018**

### <a id="features"></a> Features

New features included in this release:

* **Expanded API Functionality**: Operators can now use the API to configure plan features that are not yet exposed through the SSO dashboard.
The SSO service honors values configured through the API so that these values are retained when using the SSO dashboard.

* **Plan Visibility for All Orgs**: Operators can now enable an SSO service plan to be visible to all orgs.
Operators may want to use this feature to provide a test plan to all developers as a default.
Operators can enable or disable this mode for any new or existing service plan.

* **BOSH Backup and Restore Compatibility**: SSO now works with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR).
  For more information, see [Backing Up and Restoring](backup-and-restore.html).
  <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>:
     BBR will introduce about a minute of downtime for application login during a backup operation on PCF 2.0. Starting with PCF v2.1 and later, there is no application downtime when performing a BBR backup.
  </p>
* **Availability of Performance Data**: Performance benchmarks,
metrics, and scaling indicators are now available.
