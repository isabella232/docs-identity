This topic explains how to determine your <%= vars.product_full %> app type. 

## <a id='choose-type'></a> Determine Your <%= vars.product_short %> App Type

Before you bind or register an app, you must determine its <%= vars.product_short %> app type and the corresponding OAuth grant type.
OAuth grant types determine how the app communicates with <%= vars.product_short %> to acquire tokens for authentication and authorization purposes.

If your app authenticates end users, its <%= vars.product_short %> app type is Web App, Native App, or Single-Page JavaScript App.
If the app does not authenticate end users, but rather accesses other services or APIs on its own behalf, then its type is Service-to-Service App.

See the table below to determine your app's <%= vars.product_short %> app type and OAuth Grant Type:

| App Type  | <%= vars.product_short %> App Type | OAuth Grant Type |
|-------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|[Web](./configure-apps/web-app.html) | Web App | `authorization code` |
|[Native Mobile, Desktop, or Command Line](./configure-apps/native-app.html) | Native App | `password` (the resource owner's password) |
|[Single-Page JavaScript](./configure-apps/single-page-js-app.html)| Single-Page JavaScript App | `implicit` |
|[Service-to-Service](./configure-apps/service-to-service-app.html)| Service-to-Service App | `client_credentials` |
|[Web + Service-to-Service](./configure-apps/web-service-to-service-app.html)| Web + Service-to-Service App | `authorization_code` `client_credentials` |
| Resource Server | Secured API, Database Server | n/a |

The [<%= vars.product_short %> Service Sample Applications](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/identity-sample-apps) GitHub repository provides examples for a few of the <%= vars.product_short %> app types listed above.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong> Pivotal recommends only using the Native app type
   for highly-trusted apps, such as company-owned and managed apps.
   The Native app type only works with back-channel protocols, 
   such as internal UAA store or LDAP.
   It does not work with front-channel protocols, such as SAML.</p>
