This topic lists resources where you can learn about logging and monitoring of the Single Sign-On (SSO) service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## Auditing an SSO Service Plan
All SSO Service Plans are given a unique **Identity Zone Id**. You can audit all events using a particular plan by
filtering UAA generated logs by the plan's identity zone id.

A list of plans and their coresponding identity zone id's can be obtained from the `id` field of the
[SSO Service Plan Automation API](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/sso-api/#list-all-plans) response or
the plan URL from the SSO Operatator Dashboard.

## Auditing App Events
All PCF Bound Apps using SSO or Externally Registered Apps though the SSO Dashboard have a unique **Client Id**.
You can audit all app/uaa client events using the client id.

An app's client id can be found on the SSO Developer Dashboard as the **App ID**
