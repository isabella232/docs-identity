PingOne Cloud is an identity-as-a-service solution that delivers secure single sign-on to SaaS,
legacy and web applications. 
This documentation describes how to configure a single sign-on partnership between PingOne Cloud 
as the Identity Provider (IdP) and the Single Sign-On Service (SSO) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry as 
the Service Provider (SP).

SSO supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All SSO communication takes place over SSL.
